Contributions:

spamdforum is currently ALPHA stage!

Account system is almost completed.
Refer to: https://github.com/hahahahacker2009/www for old code to move
Needs:
- Code checking for inconsistent use of spaces, convert them to tab (tabstop=8)
- pwlvltable.php: If you have an idea about reusing the "update powerlevel"
checks for adding specially powered user, please contribute
- LANGUAGE! There isn't words_en.php!!!

Forum designing isn't open right now. Will implement it soon.
Should we have markdown support? maybe no, it suck. Asterisks, underscores
broke the whole text.
