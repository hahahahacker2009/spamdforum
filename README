spamdforum - PHP & MySQL/MariaDB simple & sane forum for the World Wide Web.
Currently alpha, forum isn't worked yet; just an account system.
Future: BCHS? (BSD, C, httpd, SQLite). PHP version will be compat & maintained,
because people will want to host it on PHP & MySQL hosting provider.

spamdforum is currently ALPHA stage!

Account system is almost completed.
TODO:
o Code checking for inconsistent use of spaces, convert them to tab
o Code quality improvement.
o pw.php: If you have an idea about reusing the "update powerlevel"
  checks for adding powered user, please contribute
o Replace the use of "echo" to "printf", because using a function to get
  the message is dumb.
o LANGUAGE! There isn't words_en.php!!!
o Configuration in the JSON format: We are currently using PHP scripts to
  store configuration. JSON configuration allows having web interface for
  configuration, which most web applications need.
  And it is much safer than using a PHP script!!!
o What is the maximum privileges?
o Scripts to install database and tables

Forum designing isn't open right now. Will implement it soon.
Threads (article, ...) = posts (comments) = msg. Stored in the same table.
Inspired by email and IM. A "post" is a msg with the relate_id of another
msg.
- How a thread should be identified?
  o relate_id=id (a msg with id=800 and relate_id=800)
  o relate_id=0
Should we have markdown support? maybe no, it suck. Asterisks, underscores
broke the whole text.
