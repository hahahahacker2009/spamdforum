spamdforum is currently at BETA stage!

Account system is almost completed. forum is usable.
The forum support enabling clickable hyperlinks and voting.
TODO:
o Code quality improvement.
o Make things more modular, store code in multiple files
o ini file for forum configuration. Currently, to config the forum,
   we have to edit the config.php file. editing ini is considered `safer'
   and more friendly to the user. Also, the admin needs to be able to
   set the powerlevel needed to do action such as edit others' msg,
   change user powerlevel, `mute' users, etc
o basic json editor to edit language files
o user authentication on /account/admin
o pw.php: If you have an idea about reusing the "update powerlevel"
   checks for adding powered user, please contribute
o rewrite html, especially header.html

Forum designing isn't open right now. Will implement it soon.
Threads (article, ...) = posts (comments) = msg. Stored in the same table.
Inspired by email and IM. A "post" is a msg with the relate_id of another
msg (called a `comment')
- How a thread should be identified?
   o relate_id=0
Should we have markdown support? maybe no, it suck. Asterisks, underscores
broke the whole text. Also, not on spamdforum.
