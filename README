spamdforum - PHP & MySQL/MariaDB simple & sane forum for the World Wide Web.
Currently alpha, forum isn't worked yet; just an account system.
Future: BCHS? (BSD, C, httpd, SQLite). PHP version will be compat & maintained,
because people will want to host it on PHP & MySQL hosting provider.

spamdforum is currently ALPHA stage!

Account system is almost completed.
Refer to: https://github.com/hahahahacker2009/www for old code to move
Needs:
- Code checking for inconsistent use of spaces, convert them to tab (tabstop=8)
- pwlvltable.php: If you have an idea about reusing the "update powerlevel"
checks for adding specially powered user, please contribute
- LANGUAGE! There isn't words_en.php!!!

Forum designing isn't open right now. Will implement it soon.
Should we have markdown support? maybe no, it suck. Asterisks, underscores
broke the whole text.
